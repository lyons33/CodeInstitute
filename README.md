# Website for The Monkees

This site was created for The Monkees, a sixties pop/rock band formed
for a TV series. It provides information and music of the band that
were dubbed "The prefab four".

## UX


This site is built with a mobile first approach.This site is for people interested knowing
more about The monkees, to listen to their music and watch videos of the band. It also provides
a history and infomation of how they were formed and what happened after they finished the TV series.

## Features



In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
The four band members appear on the header of the webpage - A screenshot was
taken from the closing credits of one of the TV show episodes then edited and 
retouched in Photoshop. The images were then placed on a framed red, orange 
and yellow background with outer-glow applied. The members names were added 
with a drop-shadow applied. The background of the header is a repeat stamp 
pattern adjusted in Photoshop, the logo and the four images were then placed 
on an over-layer.The header image is responsive - adjusting to every screen 
size from xs to xl.
The navagation bar is part of Bootstrap code and has three pages, on smaller 
screens it uses a dropdown menu.
On the landing page the layout is 3x3 and 2x2x2 and works for all screen 
sizes from xs to xl. Content for the page contains photos of the band and 
information and the history of how they formed, which was found on Wikipedia.
In the music page videos of the band are embedded from Youtube.
The members page contains the four band members reused from the header with
information of each of them.
### Features Left to Implement

In the TV series the band lived and preformed in a house in Califorina, another 
feature which could be used is an interactive map of their house, the layout connected to
images and links of clips of the band.
